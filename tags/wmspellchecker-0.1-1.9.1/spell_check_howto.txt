This is mostly from someone's blog and the scijax docs.

Steps 1-5 tell how to enable a windows machine to support php's
spellchecking api. Instead of doing steps 1-5 in linux, do something like
apt-get install aspell php5-pspell.

Steps 6+ are for windows AND linux.

1. Download and Install ASpell Win32 - http://aspell.net/win32/
Browse to the ASpell Win32 site and download the latest 'Full installer'
version for Win32 (currently GNU Aspell-0.50.3 (win32)). It is a regular
windows setup program. Run it on the server which PHP resides on and follow
the prompts to complete the installation.

2. Install a Dictionary / Dictionaries
Download dictionary files for the languages you need to support from the
same page you downloaded the ASpell binaries from. You need at least one
dictionary installed (I installed the English dictionary.) Run the windows
setup program for the dictionary(ies) on the server you installed ASpell
onto. The folder for ASpell should be automatically detected by the
dictionary setup program - so you can generally just keep hitting 'Next'
until it's installed.

3. Copy ASpell DLL's to System32
Browse to the /bin/ folder in the ASpell program directory (default is
C:\Program Files\ASpell\bin) and copy the aspell-15.dll to your
%Win32%/System32 folder (i.e. like you would for files like php4apache2.dll,
etc.) NOTE: In PHP 5.x you can probably copy aspell-15.dll to the root PHP
folder as well, but for compatibility with PHP 4.x and 5.x, use
%Win32%/System32/.

4. Edit php.ini and enable the pspell extension
Open up your php.ini and find the block where you enable extensions. I've
noticed that in both PHP 4.3.x and 5.0.x, the pspell extension DLL isn't in
the list of commented-out extensions. However, the DLL file is provided with
the PHP package and should be found in your extensions folder under
"php_pspell.dll". Thus, you must manually add a line to load this extension:
extension=php_pspell.dll

5. Fix up the aspell data files
The aspell data files have dos line-endings and need unix line-endings.  For
the english dictionary I had to modify *.dat and standard.kbd:
cd c:/Program Files/Aspell/data
dos2unix *.dat standard.kbd

------ end windows only instructions ----

------ begin of importing spellcheck to a new wiki instructions -----

6. copy the wmspellchecker.tar.gz to your mediawiki directory, the one that
has maintenance, skins, includes, etc and unzip it there.  The files should
go in the right directories.

7. Enable the spellchecker extension

Edit LocalSettings.php, add these lines:

################
include_once("extensions/spellcheck/spellcheckext.php");
$personalDictionaryLocation = "$IP/extensions/spellcheck/added_words.txt";
# if these are blank, they won't be used
$pspell_data_dir = "";
$pspell_dict_dir = "";
# on windows these seem to be needed, I don't know why
#$pspell_data_dir = "c:\\program files\\aspell\\data";
#$pspell_dict_dir = "c:\\program files\\aspell\\dict";
################

 - personalDictionaryLocation tells pspell where to store words added by users. 
  - make sure that $IP/extensions/spellcheck/added_words.txt is writable by the
webserver!
 - The last two constants tell pspell where to find data directories.  They
seem to be required on windows servers.
